## [Projects][projects]
Things I do, including research, academic course projects, and miscellaneous interests.

## [Blog][blog]
Things I think about, read, and write.

## [Stuff I Use][stuff-i-use]
Inspired by projects like [The Setup][the-setup], here is the stuff I use.

## [Monthly Music][mm]
I've been sharing music with friends for as long as I can remember, so I started making monthly public playlists for anyone who wants to tune in.
Each playlist features ten tracks and with an accompanying Spotify playlist.
For fans of indie rock, electronic music, and related genres.

<!-- # [Photos][photos]
I'm no professional photographer, but sometimes I take pictures.
I shoot with a [Nikon D80][d80], but I always have an iPhone at my side.
You can also find me on [Instagram][insta]. -->
