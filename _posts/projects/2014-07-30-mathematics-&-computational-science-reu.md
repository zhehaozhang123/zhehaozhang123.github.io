Funded by the National Science Foundation, [Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)][reu] are summer research programs for students in science, engineering, and mathematics.

I participated in [Fairfield University’s REU in Mathematics & Computational Science][fu] where I was supervised by [Dr. Shanon Reckinger][sr] of the Mechanical Engineering Department of Fairfield University. Our project directly compared numerical solutions derived from the [Navier-Stokes equations][ns] to designed experiments performed at the lab-scale to model a specific oceanic phoneme: **overflow**.

Overflows in the ocean occur when dense water flows down a continental slope into less dense ambient water. These density driven plumes occur naturally in various locations in the global ocean, but it is important to study idealized and small-scale models which allow for stronger confidence and control of parameters. 

My group designed and built an experiment to mimic oceanic overflow while also configuring the [MIT General Circulation Model][mitgcm] on a Linux computer cluster to parallel compute numerical simulations. We then directly compared our experimental data with our numerical simulations using MATLAB for pre- and post-processing visualization.

We presented our research at the [2014 REU Mini-Conference at Yale University][yale], the [2014 American Physical Society (APS) Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting][apsdfd], and we were awarded 1st place in the [2015 Joint Mathematics Meeting Undergraduate Poster Session][jmm] for Computational Mathematics.
