Here are four of the projects I completed during my coursework at UGA.

## Image Compression
<time class="post-date">May, 2014</time>

For my **Numerical Analysis II** final, I implemented [Principal Component Analysis (PCA)][pca] to perform mathematical image compression. The class’s algorithms were ranked based on visual image recovery and mine won the [50% compression category][jc]. The [project report][image_compression] introduces the reader to PCA, discusses an OS X Automator program for improving the compression algorithm, and provides the Mathematica code for compressing any arbitrary image.

## Railgun Simulation
<time class="post-date">March, 2014</time>

For my **Numerical Analysis II** midterm, I simulated the launch of a railgun projectile from Pearl Harbor, HI to a hostile watercraft 250 miles due west. The [project report][railgun_simulation] includes the relevant physical assumptions that were made, the system of ordinary differential equations modeling the projectile’s path, the code to run the simulation, and discussion and visualization of the results.

## Path Minimization
<time class="post-date">December, 2013</time>

For my **Numerical Analysis I** final, I wrote Mathematica code that implements a minimization algorithm to determine the shortest possible distance over the San Gabriel mountain range in California using topological data provided by National Elevation Dataset. The [project report][path_minimization] includes a description of the project, relevant code, and plots of the path over the given terrain.

## Numerical Ordinary Differential Equation Solution and Integration Project
<time class="post-date">May, 2013</time>

For my numerical project in **Mathematical Methods in Physics**, I developed and programmed a forty-sheet Excel workbook to solve for the solutions to a Hydrogen Combustion Model during the “ignition” and “explosive growth” phases. The [report][numerical_ode_and_integration] includes discussion and analysis of numerical error when computing complex integrals.
