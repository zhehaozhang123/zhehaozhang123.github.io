Georgia Tech, being located in Midtown Atlanta, has supposedly had gigabit internet on campus for some time now. I wanted to test the speed for myself.

To do this, I simply loaded up [speedtest.net][speedtest], plugged in my laptop to an ethernet port in the Klaus Advanced Computing Building (Georgia Tech's College of Computing), and clicked "Begin Test". The results are below.

*922.43 Mbps* download and *932.64 Mbps* upload. That's awfully quick[^fn-speed]. To put the download speed into perspective, it's roughly 37x faster than what my parents pay for outside of Atlanta, and about 12x faster than what my roommate and I pay for in the city. 

Maybe one day soon I can get gigabit internet in my apartment since Atlanta has been targeted by Google to [bring Google Fiber to parts of the city][fiber], with AT&T and Comcast [soon to follow][comcast].

Needless to say, I'm excited to be using gigabit on campus during graduate school. I did a quick Google search for "georgia tech internet speed" and sure enough, I found the following statistic in a tweet:

Just a few days after my findings, someone I follow on Twitter posted his unusually high LTE download speed, so I decided to boast about GT's speed:
