During my second week of graduate school, my new department threw a 10-year anniversary party. The event kicked off with a short presentation by our chair Dr. David Bader about the state of CSE at GT. 

Here's the short version: CSE at GT is doing fantastic and rapidly growing. In fact, it's growing so fast that CSE is moving to a brand new High Performance Computing building that will be finished in 2018[^fn-hpcc].

Once the presentation concluded, attendees were treated to food, cake, music, live visionary painting by a Georgia Tech alumnus, and a commemorative shirt and drinking glass.

Hopefully I'll be graduating when CSE has its 15 year anniversary![^fn-grad]

[^fn-hpcc]: I'll be in my third year of the Ph.D. program in 2018, so I *should* be one of the first people to occupy the new building.
[^fn-grad]: That'll put me right at 5 years: the average amount of time it takes to earn a Ph.D. in CSE.
