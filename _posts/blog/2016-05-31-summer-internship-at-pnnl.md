I'm one week into my summer work, and I finally understand where I fall in the hierarchy of the lab: I'm housed in the Data Sciences & Analytics group, in the Computational & Statistical Analytics Division, which falls under the National Security Directorate (one of the three missions of the lab).

I'll be spending 11 weeks in [Tri-Cities, Washington][tri-cities] working with [Dr. Nathan Hodas][nathan] on using **visual analytics to better understand how deep learning models semantically learn**.

During my time out West, I plan to take a few trips to places like Seattle, Portland, and possibly Vancouver. I'll also be taking a weekend getaway to Los Angles on my birthday. Looking forward to taking pictures, meeting new people, and experiencing all the Pacific Northwest has to offer this summer!
