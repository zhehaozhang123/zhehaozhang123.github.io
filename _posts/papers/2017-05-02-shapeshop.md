Deep learning is the driving force behind many recent technologies; however, deep neural networks are often viewed as "black-boxes" due to their internal complexity that is hard to understand.
Little research focuses on helping people explore and understand the relationship between a user's data and the learned representations in deep learning models.
We present our ongoing work, ShapeShop, an interactive system for visualizing and understanding what semantics a neural network model has learned.
Built using standard web technologies, ShapeShop allows users to experiment with and compare deep learning models to help explore the robustness of image classifiers.
