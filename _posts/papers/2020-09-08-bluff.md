Deep neural networks (DNNs) are now commonly used in many domains.
However, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks: carefully-crafted perturbations on data inputs that can fool a model into making incorrect predictions. 
Despite significant research on developing DNN attack and defense techniques, people still lack an understanding of how such attacks penetrate a model's internals.
We present Bluff, an interactive system for visualizing, characterizing, and deciphering adversarial attacks on vision-based neural networks.
Bluff allows people to flexibly visualize and compare the activation pathways for benign and attacked images, revealing mechanisms that adversarial attacks employ to inflict harm on a model.
Bluff is open-sourced and runs in modern web browsers.
