Dimensionality reduction is a powerful technique used by data scientists to look for hidden structure in data.
The method is useful in a number of domains, for example document categorization, protein disorder prediction, and machine learning model debugging.
The results of a dimensionality reduction algorithm can be visualized to reveal patterns and clusters of similar or dissimilar data.
Even though the data is displayed in only two or three dimensions, structures present in higher dimensions are maintained, at least roughly.
This guide will teach you how to think about these embeddings, and provide a comparison of some of the most popular dimensionality reduction algorithms used today.
