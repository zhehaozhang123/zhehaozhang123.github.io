The Parametric Press is a new interactive digital magazine that aims to break down complex topics with visualization and interactive graphics.
Built on open source research software, the platform acts as a bridge between theory and practice—a case study through which to improve interactive publishing tools and test visualization techniques in the wild—while empowering authors to tell data-driven stories and create explorable explanations.
